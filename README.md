# Introduction

This is a project for the course Embedded Machine Learning: A Software-Hardware Design Flow at The University of Hong Kong

It contains an unofficial implementation of the [Learned Step Size Quantization method paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01459). It's under `LSQ.ipynb`.

There are also pruning methods used. You can learn more about them from: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL80kAHvQbh-pT4lCkDT53zT8DKmhE0idB&si=lsepKS11RPIJKpZs

# Usage

Running these things should be straightforward. Just make sure you have pytorch.
